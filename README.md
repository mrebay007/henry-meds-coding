# Henry Meds - Front-End Engineer Coding Challenge
### Mike Eberhardt

## Goal
For this project I attempted to build a visual UI for selecting a date and timeslot for the providers and clients. The time selection for each role is the same so building a more custom UI for selection is a worthy investment while staying within the 2 hour time box. Large buttons for an ease of user confirmation. 

## Built currently
1. Client view for selecting time slots 
2. View status of current user role and ID

## With more time I would
1. Attach UI to mock values
2. Add functionality and error trapping to selections. 
3. Add a toggle to swap between "Provider" and "Client" views
